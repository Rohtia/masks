My plan here is to make an interactive character sheet for the ttrpg Masks, a game that uses the Powered by the Apocalypse game engine. I am still learning how to code (I only started coding on 17 September, 2021), so this will be a project made in stages as I learn.

_Stage 1_
* create the form for the player to enter their
  * character's name
  * character's playbook
  * character's starting Stats
* take those form entries and transform it into a character sheet

_Stage 2_
* add "dice rolling" capability, adding the stat modifiers to the roller

_Stage 3.0_
* add Potential (aka experience) counter
* add condition markers
* add Look description boxes

  _Stage 3.1_
  * factor in condition markers to dice rolls

_Stage 4_
* add in ability to save the character sheet and come back to it
